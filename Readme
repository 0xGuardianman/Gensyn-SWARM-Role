# 🤖 Gswarm Role & Telegram Bot Setup

Welcome!  
This guide will walk you through setting up the **Gswarm monitoring bot**, connecting it with **Telegram**, and linking it to **Discord** so you can earn **The Swarm role**.

Gswarm lets you keep an eye on your Gensyn swarm node’s activity directly from your phone through Telegram.

## ⚙️ Step 1 — Install Gswarm

Before anything else, make sure you have **Go (Golang)** installed and updated.

### 🧩 1. Install Go
Run the following commands to install Go 1.22.4:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
curl -L https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzf - -C /usr/local
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin' >> $HOME/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin' >> $HOME/.bash_profile
source .bash_profile
go version
```

### 🧱 2. Install Gswarm
Once Go is installed, run this command to download and install the Gswarm tool:

```bash
go install github.com/Deep-Commit/gswarm/cmd/gswarm@latest
```

If everything’s set up correctly, you’ll be able to run Gswarm from anywhere in your terminal.

✅ **Check installation:**
```bash
gswarm --version
```

## 💬 Step 2 — Create and Configure Your Telegram Bot

You’ll need a Telegram bot that can talk to your Gswarm instance.  
This only takes a couple of minutes.

### 🪄 1. Create a New Bot
1. Open Telegram and start a chat with **[@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)**  
2. Type `/newbot`  
3. Follow the prompts to name your bot and choose a username  
4. When it’s done, copy the **bot token** that BotFather gives you — you’ll need it later

### 🆔 2. Find Your Chat ID
1. Open Telegram and send a message to your new bot (like “hello”)  
2. In your browser, go to this link — replacing `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` with the token from BotFather:
   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
   ```
3. You’ll see a JSON response. Look for a section that says:
   ```json
   "chat": { "id": 123456789 }
   ```
   That number is your **chat ID** — keep it safe.

💡 *If you see no results (`"result":[]`), send another message to your bot and refresh the page.*

---

## ⚙️ Step 3 — Start the Gswarm Bot

Now, it’s time to connect everything together.

In your terminal, simply run:
```bash
gswarm
```

You’ll be asked for:
- Your **Telegram bot token**  
- Your **chat ID**  
- Your **EOA address** (found in your [Gensyn Dashboard](https://dashboard.gensyn.ai))

Once entered, Gswarm will begin monitoring your node and sending updates to your Telegram.

---

## 🔗 Step 4 — Connect Discord & Telegram

To earn *The Swarm* role, you’ll link your Telegram bot with your Discord account.

### 🧠 1. Request Your Link Code
- Join the official **Gensyn Discord**  
- Go to the channel `#|swarm-link`  
- Type:
  ```
  /link-telegram
  ```
- Discord will reply with a unique code

### 💬 2. Verify via Telegram
- Go back to your Telegram bot  
- Send the message:
  ```
  /verify <code>
  ```
  *(replace `<code>` with the one you got from Discord)*

After verification, your Discord and Telegram accounts will be linked — and you’ll receive **The Swarm role** 🌀

---

## 🧩 Optional — Keep Gswarm Running 24/7

If you want your bot to stay online even when you close your terminal, you can use **screen**:

```bash
screen -S gswarm
gswarm
```

Detach the session anytime with:
```
Ctrl + A + D
```

To come back later:
```bash
screen -r gswarm
```

---

## 🎉 You’re Done!

You’ve successfully:
- Installed **Gswarm**
- Created your **Telegram bot**
- Connected it to your **Gensyn node**
- Linked your **Discord** account
- Earned **The Swarm role**
