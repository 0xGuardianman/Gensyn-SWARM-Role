🤖 Gswarm Role & Telegram Bot Setup

Welcome!
This guide will walk you through setting up the Gswarm monitoring bot, connecting it with Telegram, and linking it to Discord to earn The Swarm role.

Gswarm allows you to monitor your Gensyn swarm node’s activity directly from your phone using Telegram.



⚙️ Step 1 — Install Gswarm

Before anything else, make sure you have Go (Golang) installed and updated.

🧩 1. Install Go

Run the following commands to install Go 1.22.4:

sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
curl -L https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzf - -C /usr/local
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin' >> $HOME/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin' >> $HOME/.bash_profile
source .bash_profile
go version

🧱 2. Install Gswarm

Once Go is installed, run this command to download and install the Gswarm tool:

go install github.com/Deep-Commit/gswarm/cmd/gswarm@latest


After installation, you can run gswarm from anywhere if your Go bin directory is in your PATH.

✅ Check installation:

gswarm --version

💬 Step 2 — Create and Configure Your Telegram Bot

You’ll need a Telegram bot that can communicate with your Gswarm instance.
This process takes just a few minutes.

🪄 1. Create a New Bot

Open Telegram and start a chat with @BotFather

Type /newbot

Follow the steps to name your bot and choose a username

Copy the bot token provided — you’ll use it soon

🆔 2. Find Your Chat ID

Send any message to your new bot on Telegram

Open this link in your browser (replace <YOUR_BOT_TOKEN> with your token):

https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates


You’ll see something like this:

"chat": { "id": 123456789 }


That number is your chat ID.

💡 If you get an empty result ("result":[]), send another message to your bot and refresh the link.

⚙️ Step 3 — Start the Gswarm Bot

Now connect everything together.

Run this command:

gswarm


You’ll be asked for:

Your Telegram Bot Token

Your Chat ID

Your EOA Address (available in your Gensyn Dashboard
)

Once done, Gswarm will start sending live node updates to your Telegram chat.

🔗 Step 4 — Link Discord & Telegram

To earn The Swarm Discord role, you’ll need to link your Telegram and Discord accounts.

🧠 1. Get a Link Code

Open the official Gensyn Discord

Go to the #|swarm-link channel

Type:

/link-telegram


You’ll receive a one-time verification code

💬 2. Verify in Telegram

Go back to your Telegram bot

Send:

/verify <code>


(Replace <code> with the code from Discord)

✅ Once verified, your Discord and Telegram accounts will be linked — and you’ll receive The Swarm Role 🌀

🧩 Optional — Keep Gswarm Running in the Background

If you want the bot to stay active even when you close your terminal, use screen:

screen -S gswarm
gswarm


Detach the session:

Ctrl + A + D


To return later:

screen -r gswarm

🎉 You’re Done!

You’ve successfully:

Installed Gswarm

Created a Telegram bot

Connected it to your Gensyn node

Linked it with Discord

Earned The Swarm role

🚀 Monitor smarter. Stay connected. Join The Swarm. ⚡
